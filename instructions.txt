>This is a Python code for extracting data from web pages and performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the extracted data. Here are the instructions for this code:

>First, the necessary libraries are imported, including pandas, requests, numpy, BeautifulSoup, and nltk.

>The paths for the positive and negative word list, stopword list, and input file (a CSV file) are set.

>Positive, negative, and stopword lists are created by reading data from the respective files.

>Pronouns are removed from the stopword list.

>The NLTK library is used to tokenize the words in the input file.

>The input file is read into a DataFrame using the pandas library.

>A list of unwanted lines is created to remove these lines from the articles.

>The code loops through all links in the input file, web scrapes the data from the web pages, removes unwanted lines, and stores the article text in the main_text list.

>The scikit-learn library's CountVectorizer method is used to create a bag of words for the extracted text.

>The resulting bag of words is stored in the X variable.

>The sentiment analysis is performed using the NLTK library's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer method, and the resulting sentiment scores are stored in the sentiment_scores list.

>The code loops through the sentiment_scores list and calculates the average sentiment score for each article.

>The average sentiment score for each article is added to the input DataFrame as a new column.

>Finally, the input DataFrame is written to a CSV file.
